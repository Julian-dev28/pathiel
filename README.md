# Pathiel
> Autonomous trading agent for Hyperliquid, restricted to majors — BTC/ETH, gold, silver, oil, the broad indices, and the mega-caps. A standalone Python system built with FastAPI and a pluggable AI brain (OpenRouter default; Claude/Codex CLI optional), operated by [Pathiel Agent](https://github.com/Julian-dev28/pathiel-agent) through an MCP server.

**How you drive it: MCP.** The whole control surface is an MCP server —
`scripts/pathiel-mcp-server.py`, 88 tools over stdio. Scanning, research,
execution, config, risk state, Hyperliquid market data and the wallets signed in
to the dashboard are all tools an agent calls. There is no second API to learn
and no framework dependency in the engine: point Claude Desktop, Pathiel Agent or
any MCP client at it and you are operating the system. Full table under
[MCP Integration](#mcp-integration).

**What it does:** Scans the majors universe, fires statistical triggers on
price/volume/breakout signals, runs a cheap pre-AI technical analysis filter,
and only calls AI on CONFIRMED setups. Executes with DSL-managed dynamic exits.

**What it mostly does, honestly:** kills ideas. The measurement layer — the
recorders, the shadow ledger, the point-in-time grader — has correctly refuted
perpetual-candle trading (a 2-minute BTC move averages 0.028% against a 0.09%
round trip), prediction-market forecasting (n=263 against a market already at
Brier 0.088), Markov regime models, numerology, social-surge signals, and a
"top 25 leaderboard" that lost to random 2000 times out of 2000. That is the
part of this system that reliably works, and it is worth more than the trading.

### Read this before funding it

- **Five books, all LIVE.** There is no shadow tier: a book trades or it does
  not exist. `shadow_only` exists only as the switch
  `scripts/autonomous_cycle.py` flips to demote a book whose forward ledger
  turns negative.
- The account is sized for $12.94 (2026-09-04): $11 notional at 1x,
  `max_concurrent` 1, daily kill at -$4. See **Sizing a small account** below.

| book | n | EV@25bps | OOS halves | null p |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `news_surge_short` | 255 | +1.24% | +0.58 / +2.16 | 0.0005 |
| `news_surge_multi` | 230 | +1.87% | +1.50 / +2.50 | 0.0005 |
| `social_trending` | 185 | +0.89% | +0.54 / +1.50 | 0.0005 |
| `unlock_short_runin` | 14 | +3.75% | +0.71 / +7.06 | 0.0375 |
| `xs_reversal` | 1995 | +2.47% | quartiles +4.94/+0.70/+0.89/+3.05 | 0.0000 |

These are FORWARD-ledger grades, not realized P&L. This repo has a documented
history of books whose comments claimed +EV while they ran live and lost.

`xs_reversal` (2026-09-04, findings/W-XSR1) shorts the top decile of 3-day
cross-sectional return, but only where funding has spent >= 67% of the last 7
days off Hyperliquid's 1.25e-05 baseline — no positioning means nothing to
unwind, and the pinned bucket loses 0.443%. It carries one honest discount the
others do not: that gate was **found, not pre-registered**. It fell out of a
different test that was failing.

### No recorders, no shadow

Every book trades and has a switch `scripts/autonomous_cycle.py` can flip, or it
does not exist. There is no third state, and tests enforce that in the defaults
and in the live config.

**Start the loop and five books place real orders unattended.** What bounds
them is the equity floor in `executor.maybe_execute`, the per-book margin check,
the majors allowlist, the daily-loss kill switch, and the nightly grader that
demotes any book whose forward ledger turns negative.

### Sizing a small account

Two gates stand between an account and a fill, and clearing one does nothing:

| gate | where | at $12.94 |
|---|---|---|
| equity floor | `executor.min_tradable_equity` | derived $88.89, overridden to $12 |
| per-position margin | `executor.maybe_execute` | $11 notional at 1x needs $11 |
| exchange minimum | `client.exchange.MIN_ORDER_USD` | $10.50 |
| free-margin floor | `min_available_margin_pct` | 10%, leaving $11.65 usable |

$11 is the only notional that clears the exchange minimum and fits usable
margin. `max_concurrent` is 1 because exactly one position fits.

The derived $88.89 floor is what all five books need to hold a position *at
once*; below it the first book to fire consumes the budget and the rest sit
margin-blocked, which from outside looks like books that simply do not fire
(W-FUND1). `min_tradable_equity_usd` overrides it deliberately, and
`.agent-config.json` carries a note on what to restore when funded.

The exemption list that used to hold ten capital-less books is empty and a test
keeps it empty. It produced exactly the failure it sounds like: on 2026-08-29
the grader printed `unlock_short — VALIDATED: validated but has no bounded
capital path`. A book that can prove itself and still never trade costs budget,
log volume and attention to maintain evidence nothing may act on.

---

## What was removed (2026-08-29)

The candle-strategy space is saturated and the perp fee math is fatal, not
fixable. Deleted rather than disabled, because a half-removal that leaves a live
route is worse than either end state:

- **17 strategy books** and every order-placing call site, plus `pathiel/v2/`
  (a parallel engine whose only three signal generators were among them)
- **The entire prediction-market side** — the arb crossed 2 of 276 sampled
  windows and the forecasts lost to the market's own calibration

What survives is the engine: ingestion, the TA filter, the risk gates, the
executor, the DSL exit engine, the shadow ledger and its grader, and the three
mover-recorder live arms. Roughly 26,000 lines came out.

---

## MCP Integration

pathiel is a standalone Python application; **Pathiel Agent operates it through this MCP server** — that is the whole integration boundary. The agent calls the tools below; the trading engine itself has no Pathiel-framework dependency.

The MCP server (`scripts/pathiel-mcp-server.py`) exposes 88 tools over stdio transport. The 18 primary tools are listed below; the remainder are Hyperliquid data passthroughs (some are placeholders pending SDK wiring).

**The wallet boundary, because an agent will ask.** `connected_wallets` and
`wallet_account` report on wallets that signed in to the dashboard, and they are
read-only by construction rather than by policy. A SIWE sign-in grants a
session, not a key; this server signs with the deployment's own key and holds no
other. So there is no path — through these tools or any other — by which an
agent places, closes or resizes an order on a visitor's account. `connected_wallets`
says so in its own response payload (`can_this_server_trade_them: false`), because
the alternative is an agent inferring otherwise and telling a user it can trade
for them.

| `state` | Get full agent state (mode, equity, positions, trades) |
| `config` | Get/set agent configuration (mode, risk caps, thresholds, `ai_brain`) |
| **Connected wallets** (read-only) | |
| `connected_wallets` | Wallets that signed in to the dashboard over SIWE, newest first |
| `wallet_account` | Read-only Hyperliquid equity + positions for any address |
| **Hyperfeed Discovery** | |

Configure in Pathiel Agent's `config.yaml`:
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  pathiel:
    command: python3
    args:
      - /path/to/pathiel/scripts/pathiel-mcp-server.py
    cwd: /path/to/pathiel
    timeout: 60
    env:

## CLI Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start/restart autonomous trading loop + dashboard API
scripts/restart.sh

# 2. Confirm there is one loop process and one API server
scripts/restart.sh status

# 3. Monitor
tail -f logs/trading_loop.log
python3 scripts/preflight_live.py    # secrets, capital, books, feed, processes
python3 scripts/book_status.py       # where each live book stands
```

Dashboard served at `http://localhost:8000` (port from `PATHIEL_PORT`).

## The problem it solves

Trading signals appear constantly — 5-minute spikes, hourly trends, daily breakouts. Most systems call expensive AI on every signal, burning tokens on noise. Pathiel-Trader solves this by separating cheap statistical analysis from expensive AI reasoning:

1. **Scan** — the majors universe in parallel with volume pre-filtering and rate-limit-aware batching. The allowlist is applied at scan time, not just at the entry gate, so the tail costs nothing in candles or AI calls
2. **TA Filter** — multi-timeframe indicators (EMA, RSI, ATR, ADX, volume) — zero AI cost
3. **AI Research** — only on CONFIRMED signals, plus any fired momentum burst, through the selected AI brain provider
4. **Execution** — ATR equal-risk sizing, Hyperliquid-valid order normalization, and DSL dynamic exits (loss protection → profit locking)
5. **Discovery** — built-in Hyperfeed Discovery replicates Smart Money leaderboards and whale signals

This architecture reduced daily AI costs from $8-$52 to $3-$10 while improving signal quality.

## The failure modes it now refuses to hide

Every one of these was a real silent failure in this system, where broken and
"nothing to report" were indistinguishable. Each is now something that fails
loudly, blocks, or pages:

| was silent | now |
|---|---|
| A dead trading loop read as healthy | `/api/health/system` returns 503; `PathielLoopDead` alerts |
| An exchange outage read as a quiet market | Entries blocked while the scan feed is degraded |
| A withdrawal read as a trading loss | Drawdown is flow-neutral; capital flows are recorded |
| An unusable AI brain read as a PASS verdict | `provider_readiness()` gates the deploy and the healthcheck |
| `mode: LIVE` on a dust account | Structural floor in the executor; no config can bypass it |
| Logs growing until the disk filled | Rotation, a directory cap, and a disk guard on startup |
| A crash mid-write dropping every claim | Atomic writes with fsync on the state that matters |
| Tests passing on one laptop only | CI installs from a lockfile and rejects absolute paths |

## Key Features

### Rate-Limit-Aware Scan Pipeline
- **Volume pre-filtering**: Top-N markets by 24h notional volume plus mover and rotating-sweep slots
- **Parallel batch scanning**: Workers fan out within batches, sleep between
- **TTL caching**: 5m candles are cached inside the scan interval; 1h enrichment is cached longer and only fetched for surfaced markets
- **Configurable**: `PATHIEL_SCAN_INTERVAL`, `PATHIEL_MAX_MARKETS`, `PATHIEL_SCAN_WORKERS`, `PATHIEL_BATCH_SIZE`, `PATHIEL_BATCH_SLEEP`

### Pluggable AI Brain
- **Single seam**: `research._call_ai()` delegates to `pathiel/agents/ai_brain.py`; every provider returns verdict text for the same `parse_verdict()` contract.
- **Providers**: `openrouter` (default), `claude_cli`, and `codex_cli`.
- **Hot switch**: set `AI_BRAIN_PROVIDER` or `.agent-config.json` → `ai_brain.provider` to switch without code changes. Config is read on each research call.
- **Failure-safe**: provider failure, timeout, empty output, or CLI JSON-less output returns `""`, which becomes `ai_down=True` and a PASS that cannot be upgraded by the TA sidestep path.
- **OpenRouter preserved**: the 402 affordability retry still downgrades `max_tokens` once before failing closed.

### DSL (Dynamic Stop-Loss) Exit Engine
- **Phase 1 — Loss Protection**: Hard stop at the tighter of `max_loss_pct` or `max_loss_roe_pct / leverage` in spot terms, optionally widened to a volatility-scaled `atr_stop` (ATR×mult, clamped to floor/ceiling). Current live new-entry config is `2.5%` spot / `15%` ROE with `atr_stop` enabled (1.5× ATR, 1.0–2.5% clamp).
- **Phase 2 — Profit Locking**: Activated once price moves `protect_pct` in your favor. Current live new-entry config arms at `1.25%`, trails with a tight `retrace_threshold=0.10` (banks give-backs early), then loosens via `phase2_tiers` at `+8%` (0.35) and `+15%` (0.40) so proven runners get room; the floor ratchets one-way and never gives back locked profit.
- **Hard/stale timeout**: `hard_timeout_minutes` is the maximum hold horizon; `stale_flat_timeout_minutes` exits positions that never reach the profit-lock phase.
- **Auto-registration**: Every executed position is registered for DSL tracking
- **Persisted across restarts**: Tracker state (peak, floor, breach counter) is written to `.dsl-state.json` on every advance, so a daemon restart doesn't reset the ratchet
- **Exchange reconciliation**: Each scan tick, trackers are reconciled with live exchange positions — manually-opened or externally-closed positions stay in sync; positions opened before the engine shipped are synthesized from `entryPx`
- **Auto-close**: When a tick trips a floor/stop/timeout, the trading loop market-closes the position and logs a `dsl_exit` event to the session log. No human in the loop

### Risk & Resilience Gates
- **Regime-aware gating**: trades are scored against the asset's applicable trend regime — BTC for native crypto, own-trend-first for tokenized equities, and own trend for commodities. Aligned trades clear at `aligned_min_conf`; counter-regime trades need `counter_regime_min_conf`. `block_counter_trend_bypass` stops weak own-coin trigger bypasses from sneaking longs into a downtrend.
- **Short-specific liquidity floor**: shorts require deeper 24h volume (`min_short_volume_usd`) than longs — thin markets squeeze.
- **Free-margin floor**: `min_available_margin_pct` blocks new entries once free margin gets thin, capping over-leverage and correlated stacking.
- **Correlation cap**: `max_crypto_long_correlated` limits simultaneous correlated crypto exposure.
- **Self-healing watchdog**: the loop re-execs itself if a scan cycle hangs; the watchdog is armed *before* startup network I/O so it also covers startup hangs.
- **Partial-dex degraded-read guard**: a HIP-3 dex that fails to fetch no longer drops its equity from the aggregate — prevents false "huge loss" reads from poisoning memory or tripping the kill switch.
- **Re-entry backstop**: a DSL-registry check prevents position stacking when a live read flakes (restart / 429 window).

### Hyperfeed Discovery (Native, no MCP)
Replicates the Hyperfeed MCP plugin's data directly from HL API:
- `leaderboard_get_markets(limit)` — top markets by OI + volume
- `market_get_funding_regime()` — LONG_CROWDED / SHORT_CROWDED / NEUTRAL analysis
- `whale_concentration()` — identifies assets with whale accumulation
- `oi_funding_anomaly()` — OI spike + negative funding + flat price = accumulation signal
- `discovery_get_top_traders(...)` — trader rankings with win rates
- `market_get_asset_data(asset)` — candles + funding + OI for any coin

| `/news` | News-catalyst reads + research events with news context |
| `/trends` | Trend analysis + forecasts (see `services/trend_engine/README.md`) |
| `/analytics` | Funnel, book league, coin chart with our trade markers, funding heat |

Keyboard: `g` then `d` / `a` / `n` / `p` / `t` / `y`.

### Who can see this

Every `/api/dashboard` route was open until 2026-09-04. Verified against the
running app, an anonymous GET returned equity, free balance, daily P&L, open
positions, net capital in, and the full trade history. Anyone with the URL had
the books.

Reads are closed by default now, and there are two tiers:

| surface | who | route |
|---|---|---|
| the **house** account | operator role only | `/api/dashboard/summary`, `/risk`, `/positions`, `/closed-trades`, `/equity-curve`, `/funnel`, `/book_league` |
| **your own** account | any signed-in wallet | `/api/dashboard/account` |
| health probes | anyone | `/api/health*` — a check that needs a session cannot report a broken session |

Sign-in is **Sign-In With Ethereum** (EIP-4361), no vendor. `eth-account` is
already a hard dependency because it signs the Hyperliquid orders, so this cost
zero new dependencies and no third party learns anyone's wallet. There are no
passwords in the system.

`/api/dashboard/account` reads the caller's own Hyperliquid account **with no
stored key**: `/info clearinghouseState` takes a plain address, and the
signature already proved the caller controls it. The product can show a
customer their balance while remaining structurally unable to trade it.

- The **first wallet to sign in claims operator**, which closes the
  open-kill-switch window on a fresh box without a bootstrap password to leak.
  If something else gets there first, `scripts/grant_operator.py` is the way
  back.
- Set `PATHIEL_AUTH_DOMAIN` to the real host before deploying, or every
  signature is rejected for a domain mismatch.
- `PATHIEL_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD=1` restores the old open reads for a genuinely
  private single-operator box. Named to be obvious in a diff and in
  `fly secrets list`.
- `PATHIEL_OPERATOR_TOKEN` still exists and is now scoped to **machine callers
  only** — the scheduler, the supervisor, smoke checks. It is one static string
  for the whole deployment: it cannot say who acted, cannot be revoked for one
  person, and cannot rotate without restarting everything. It is not a login.

API keys for `services/pathiel_data_api` are minted by a signed-in wallet at
`/auth/keys` and belong to it. Only the SHA-256 is stored, so a leaked database
yields no usable credential and "show it to me again" is not a feature that can
exist.

---

## Configuration

There are two config files, and they bootstrap **differently**:

| File | Ships with repo? | You… | Read |
|------|------------------|------|------|
| **`.agent-config.json`** | **Yes — tracked**, comes pre-populated with the live strategy | **edit** it (don't create) | fresh on every trade — no restart |
| **`.env.local`** | **No — gitignored** | **create** it: `cp .env.local.example .env.local`, fill in keys | at process start — restart to apply |

So on a fresh clone: `.agent-config.json` is already there (tweak the values); `.env.local` does not exist until you copy the example and add your credentials. If `.agent-config.json` is ever missing or malformed, the loader falls back to the tuned default config with `"mode": "OFF"` (analyse-only, no orders) — it fails safe, never trades blind. Partial configs are normalized against the same defaults, and bad nested strategy blocks are ignored rather than wiping stop/gate settings.

### `.env.local` — credentials & runtime

Copy `.env.local.example` → `.env.local` and fill in:

#                                markets / too much batch_sleep) trips it — keep
#                                MAX_MARKETS+SWEEP fast enough that a cycle stays well under.
# PATHIEL_PORT=8000             # FastAPI server port
```

Keep `MAX_MARKETS + UNIVERSE_SWEEP` within HL's ~1200 weight/min budget — a wider per-cycle scan must be paced (`BATCH_SLEEP`) or it 429-storms AND trips the watchdog. For full-universe coverage prefer the **rotating sweep** (fast cycles, full coverage over time) over one giant slow scan. See [Rate Limit Math](#rate-limit-math).

When `enable_hip3=true`, the budget splits into `(PATHIEL_MAX_MARKETS - PATHIEL_MAX_MARKETS_HIP3)` crypto slots + `PATHIEL_MAX_MARKETS_HIP3` HIP-3 slots, each sorted by 24h volume independently. Without this split, BTC/ETH/SOL/etc. dominate the single sorted list and tokenized-equity perps (e.g. `xyz:CRCL` $34M, `xyz:DRAM` $22M) never get candles fetched — so their +20% / −8% swings never surface a signal.

### `.agent-config.json` — trading behaviour & risk

The live trading knobs. Read fresh on **every trade**, so edits take effect on the
next cycle — no restart. Keys are read tolerantly: `snake_case` or `camelCase`
both resolve (`max_trade_notional_usd` ≡ `maxTradeNotionalUsd`).

The snippet above is the current live strategy shape, not a guarantee that those
values are optimal in future market regimes. Missing keys are filled from
`pathiel.agents.config_store.DEFAULT_CONFIG`; keep the tracked
`.agent-config.json` explicit so reviews show intentional strategy changes.

| Key | What it does | Fallback/default |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| `mode` | `OFF` = analyse only, no orders · `LIVE` = place real orders | `OFF` |
| `equity_fraction_per_trade` | Fraction of perp equity committed as margin per trade when ATR risk sizing is disabled — see [Trade Sizing](#trade-sizing) | `0.01` |
| `leverage` | Leverage **ceiling** — each trade uses `min(this, the coin's own max)`. Coin maxes differ (BOME 3×, BTC 40×). Set high (e.g. 40) to ride each coin's max. Also multiplies position notional. | `5` |
| `min_ai_confidence` | Minimum AI confidence for a LONG/SHORT to execute | `0.8` |
| `max_concurrent` | Max simultaneous open positions | `3` |
| `max_trade_notional_usd` | Hard ceiling on a single trade's notional | `350` |
| `asset_notional_multiplier` | Optional asset-bucket sizing scale applied after risk sizing. Defaults neutral; use it only for controlled risk experiments, not as the primary alpha fix. | `{"crypto": 1.0, "hip3": 1.0}` |
| `max_total_notional_pct` | Ceiling on combined open notional, as a multiple of equity | `1.0` |
| `max_daily_loss_usd` | Daily-loss kill switch (negative number). **Size it to the account**: a -$100 kill on a $12.94 account can never fire, so the switch is decorative. | `-100` |
| `min_tradable_equity_usd` | Operator override of the derived equity floor. Precedence #1, ahead of the per-book requirement and the $25 exchange backstop. A negative or non-numeric value falls back rather than disabling the floor — a typo must not unlock trading on a dust account. | *(unset)* |
| `notional_usd` (per book) | Fixed notional per position. Must clear `MIN_ORDER_USD` ($10.50) and fit equity less `min_available_margin_pct`. | `20.0` |
| `daily_giveback_halt_pct` | **Give-back breaker**: once the day peaks ≥ `daily_giveback_min_peak_usd`, halt NEW entries if it retraces more than this from peak (existing positions ride their stops; resets at UTC roll). Locks green days from round-tripping | `0` (off) |
| `daily_giveback_min_peak_usd` | Arm threshold for the give-back breaker — stays disarmed until the day's peak PnL reaches this | `20` |
| `tp_scale_fraction` | Fraction auto-banked at the TP target (server-side reduce-only trigger at ~1 ATR); rest rides the trail. Captures profit instead of round-tripping | `0.5` |
| `crowded_with_min_conf` | **Squeeze caution**: a with-the-crowd aligned trade (short into `SHORT_CROWDED` / long into `LONG_CROWDED`) must clear this conf or it's blocked `via:crowded_squeeze` | `0` (off) |
| `min_available_margin_pct` | Block new trades when free margin drops below this fraction of equity — caps over-leverage/stacking. Lower = deploys more aggressively | `0.10` |
| `min_market_volume_usd` | Skip markets below this 24h volume | `5_000_000` |
| `min_short_volume_usd` | Extra 24h-volume floor for **shorts only** — thin markets squeeze, so shorts need deeper liquidity | `0` |
| `cooldown_min` | Minutes before re-trading the same coin | `60` |
| `counter_regime_min_conf` | Confidence bar for a trade **against** the regime (e.g. long in a downtrend) | `0.7` |
| `aligned_min_conf` | Confidence bar for a trade **with** the regime (trend-aligned) — typically lower than the counter-regime bar | _unset_ |
| `block_counter_trend_bypass` | When `true`, own-coin trigger bypasses cannot override the counter-regime gate — stops long-into-downtrend bleed | `false` |
| `override_max_daily_extension_pct` | Max positive 24h move allowed for PASS→LONG TA sidestep. Blocks parabolic chase entries (e.g. TNSR +70%, which backtests −EV above 30% extension). `0` disables | `30` |
| `backup_sl_max_frac_of_liq` | Caps server-side backup stop distance to this fraction of the approximate liquidation buffer | `0.60` |
| `max_crypto_long_correlated` | Cap on simultaneous correlated crypto positions (concentration guard) | `2` |
| `coin_allowlist` | If non-empty, **only** these coins are tradeable | `[]` (all) |
| `coin_blocklist` | Coins that are never traded | `[]` |

**Nested blocks** (all in `.agent-config.json`, all hot-read for new entries):

- **`ai_brain`** — verdict provider selection. `provider` can be `openrouter`,
  `claude_cli`, or `codex_cli`; `AI_BRAIN_PROVIDER` overrides it. CLI providers
  run in cheap/headless mode by default and must emit the same final-line verdict
  JSON as OpenRouter. On any provider failure the result is `ai_down=True` PASS.
- **`dsl_exit`** — trailing-stop engine. `max_loss_pct` and `max_loss_roe_pct`
  are the hard stop, with the tighter spot-equivalent value binding; the optional
  `atr_stop` sub-block widens it to a volatility-scaled stop (`atr_mult` × ATR,
  clamped to `floor_pct`/`ceiling_pct`). Current live new-entry values are
  `max_loss_pct=2.5`, `max_loss_roe_pct=25`, `atr_stop` enabled (1.5×, 1.0–2.5%),
  `protect_pct=1.25`, and a tight `retrace_threshold=0.10`. `phase2_tiers` is the
  profit-scaled give-back ladder (loosens the trail on proven runners: +8%→0.35,
  +15%→0.40). `stale_flat_timeout_minutes` (480) exits positions that never reach
  the profit-lock phase. Tracker state → `.dsl-state.json` (override
  `PATHIEL_DSL_STATE_FILE`). Existing open positions keep the policy captured at
  entry; config edits affect new entries and synthesized trackers.
- **`atr_risk_sizing`** `{enabled, risk_per_trade_pct, sizing_basis}` —
  equal-risk position sizing: target risk = `risk_per_trade_pct × equity`, converted
  to notional from the configured stop distance. Current live uses
  `risk_per_trade_pct=0.2` and `sizing_basis="primary_stop"`. This overrides the
  flat `equity_fraction_per_trade` path; volatile/wide-stop coins get smaller size.
- **`ta_sidestep_force_execute`** — the only remaining PASS upgrade path. It can
  upgrade an AI PASS to LONG only on composite>=runner minimum or momentumBurst,
  never on slow-burn alone, never when AI is down, and never above
  `override_max_daily_extension_pct`. The upgraded LONG still must pass the
  normal runner gate.
- **`late_chase_relax`** `{enabled, min_ext_pct, max_ext_pct, min_volume_usd}` —
  narrows the runner gate's "late trend-only chase" block:
  trend-aligned entries with no fresh breakout are admitted ONLY on liquid coins
  (vol ≥ `min_volume_usd`) inside the `[min_ext_pct, max_ext_pct]` daily-extension
  band — the one pocket backtested +EV / OOS-robust (20–30% ext, +0.15–0.20%/t).
  Low-liquidity and out-of-band chases stay blocked.
- **`capital_rotation`** `{enabled, min_candidate_composite,
  min_hold_minutes, protect_winner_roe_pct}` — when a strong fresh candidate is
  blocked purely by capital (book full / notional cap), evicts the weakest
  non-winner (roe < `protect_winner_roe_pct`, held ≥ `min_hold_minutes`) to make
  room.
- **The four live books**, each bounded at $20/1x with a 15% stop and a 1-day
  horizon — the geometry each was graded on. `scripts/autonomous_cycle.py`
  grades them nightly and demotes anything its own forward ledger refutes;
  `scripts/book_status.py` shows where each stands without needing the exchange.

Trigger internals (weights, sigma thresholds, candle interval) live separately in
`pathiel/agents/config.py` — edit there to tune the scan itself.

**TL;DR — where to set what:** strategy/risk knobs → `.agent-config.json` (live,
no restart); credentials + scan/infra env → `.env.local` (restart to apply); scan
trigger internals → `pathiel/agents/config.py` (restart).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Hyperliquid wallet with private key
- OpenRouter API key ([openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)) for the default `openrouter` brain, or non-interactive Claude/Codex CLI auth for `claude_cli` / `codex_cli`
- (Optional) Brave Search API key for news

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Julian-dev28/pathiel
cd pathiel

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (editable, with dev extras: pytest + ruff)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Configure
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your keys
```

## Running

### Trading Loop + API Server
```bash
# Start or restart both long-running processes
scripts/restart.sh

# Check process status
scripts/restart.sh status

# Follow logs
tail -f logs/trading_loop.log
```
The API is available at `http://localhost:8000`. Health check: `GET /` returns `{"service": "Pathiel-Trader", "version": "0.3.0", "status": "running"}`.

`scripts/restart.sh` manages the autonomous trading loop and the FastAPI server,
including stop/verify/start and log files under `logs/`. The MCP stdio server is
not managed by this script; Pathiel Agent respawns it on tool calls.

### Manual Process Launch
```bash
# Foreground loop, useful while debugging
python scripts/trading_loop.py

# API server only
python -m pathiel.server
# or: uvicorn pathiel.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The `--env prod --daemon` flags are informational only; they do not fork the
process. Use `scripts/restart.sh` for normal operation.

**Trading Loop Behavior:**
- Scans the top ~45 markets (by 24h volume) plus mover slots and a rotating universe sweep, every 60 seconds
- Each tick, reconciles DSL trackers with live exchange positions and runs an exit pass — market-closes anything whose dynamic floor, hard stop, or timeout has tripped
- Runs the TA filter on each trigger — only CONFIRMED signals (or fired momentum bursts) reach AI research
- Researches qualifying signals with the selected AI brain provider (`openrouter`, `claude_cli`, or `codex_cli`)
- Executes trades that clear all 11 risk gates
- Runs continuously until stopped

---

## Testing

```bash
pytest                          # offline unit tests — fast, no network, CI-safe
pytest -m online                # read-only tests against the live Hyperliquid public API
PATHIEL_E2E=1 pytest -m live      # real-money e2e: places a tiny order, calls the LLM
```

`online` and `live` tests are deselected by default. The `live` suite spends
real funds (a ~$14 round-trip order plus a billable AI-brain call) and is
additionally gated behind `PATHIEL_E2E=1` so it can never run by accident.

### Backtests and Grid Sweeps

Logged-replay backtests use the real saved AI verdicts from `.agent-memory.json`
and route them through the current gates/exits:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/backtest_logged.py --hours 168 --summary-only \
  --mode sidestep --force-bar 30 \
  --apply-runner-gate --regime-mode neutral --slippage-bps 5

.venv/bin/python scripts/strategy_grid_search.py --hours 168 --profile blend \
  --mode sidestep --force-bar 30 \
  --regime-mode neutral --slippage-bps 5
```

Treat these as replay diagnostics, not proof of future profit. The live outcome
store, with slippage/funding/hold-time capture, is the source of truth once the
sample is large enough.

## Operating via Pathiel Agent

With the skill loaded and the MCP server registered (see [MCP Integration](#mcp-integration)),
you operate pathiel by prompting your Pathiel Agent in plain language — the agent
calls the MCP tools for you. Restart your Pathiel session first so the skill and MCP
server are picked up.

| Goal | Prompt to give Pathiel |
|------|-----------------------|
| **Check state** | *Load the pathiel skill and show me its current state — mode, equity, open positions, recent trades.* |
| **Configure** (`OFF` analyzes only, `LIVE` places real orders) | *Set pathiel to LIVE mode with a max trade size of $20.* |
| **Scan** | *Scan the markets with pathiel and list what triggered, with composite scores.* |
| **Research** | *Research the top candidate and tell me the verdict, side, and confidence.* |
| **Run one full cycle** | *Run a pathiel cycle: scan, run the TA filter, research the best candidate, and execute it if the verdict is LONG or SHORT. Tell me what happened.* |
| **Start continuous trading** | *Start the pathiel trading loop in the background, then confirm it is running.* |
| **Stop continuous trading** | *Stop the pathiel trading loop.* |
| **Monitor (in session)** | *Check pathiel's status and tell me if anything changed since the last report.* |

"Start continuous trading" should use `scripts/restart.sh loop`, which starts
the same scan -> TA-filter -> research -> execute loop on its own every
`PATHIEL_SCAN_INTERVAL` seconds, independent of the Pathiel session.

For **hands-off monitoring**, nothing needs resuming: `scripts/scheduler.py`
already runs the watch on its own clock, started by `scripts/restart.sh`. It
supervises the processes, evaluates `k8s/prometheusrule.yaml` every two minutes
and delivers what fires, and snapshots state nightly.

cron and launchd are NOT options on this machine and never were: macOS TCC
denies both access to `~/Documents`, so a job defined there never runs and
never says why. That is why the scheduler exists.

```bash
python3 scripts/preflight_live.py    # one-shot readiness, anything blocking a trade
tail -f logs/alerts.log              # every alert that fired or resolved
tail -f logs/supervisor.log          # every process restart
```

---

## Trade Sizing

The current live path uses ATR equal-risk sizing in `executor.py`:

```
target_risk_usd = perp_equity × atr_risk_sizing.risk_per_trade_pct
raw_notional    = target_risk_usd / primary_stop_distance_pct
trade_notional  = clamp(raw_notional, max_trade_notional_usd, leverage caps)
```

Then the executor converts the target notional into the exact Hyperliquid-valid
coin size before risk gates run. That prevents a small intended trade from
passing gates and then being silently enlarged by exchange minimum-order logic.

Relevant knobs live in `.agent-config.json`:

| Key | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `atr_risk_sizing.enabled` | Use stop-distance-based equal-risk sizing | `true` |
| `atr_risk_sizing.risk_per_trade_pct` | Fraction of equity risked at the primary stop | `0.02` = 2% |
| `atr_risk_sizing.sizing_basis` | Stop source for sizing | `primary_stop` |
| `leverage` | Leverage ceiling — each trade uses `min(this, coin's own max)`; pushed to the exchange via `set_leverage` | `10` = up to 10× |
| `max_trade_notional_usd` | Hard cap on a single trade's notional | `350` |
| `equity_fraction_per_trade` | Fallback margin fraction when ATR sizing is disabled | `0.20` = 20% |

When ATR sizing is disabled, the fallback formula is:

```
trade_notional = perp_equity × equity_fraction_per_trade × leverage
```

Caps that bound both sizing paths: `max_concurrent`, `max_total_notional_pct`,
`max_trade_notional_usd`, exchange max leverage, available margin, and the
coin-specific precision/minimum order. Config keys are read tolerantly —
`snake_case` or `camelCase` both work.

Defaults if the keys are absent: `equity_fraction_per_trade = 0.01`, `leverage = 5`.

## Design Decisions

### Why volume pre-filtering?
HL's API rate limit is **1200 weight/minute**. A single candle fetch costs **weight 20**. Scanning the full 500+ market universe naively required 10,000+ weight -> instant 429. The majors allowlist removes most of that pressure on its own. Volume pre-filtering to 45 core markets plus a small rotating sweep leaves room for mids, HIP-3 metadata, dashboard/account calls, and occasional 1h enrichment. Sustained usage is roughly `1200 * markets / interval` weight/min, so the safe rule is **markets plus sweep should stay below the scan interval in seconds**.

### Why DSL exit engine?
Static SL/TP orders don't adapt to price action. The DSL engine implements a two-phase design: Phase 1 protects your capital (hard stop), Phase 2 locks in profits (trailing floor with tiered retrace thresholds). The floor only moves up — it never gives back locked profit. State is persisted on disk so a daemon restart doesn't reset the ratchet, and the registry is reconciled against the exchange each tick so manually-opened or externally-closed positions stay coherent. This pattern is inspired by senpi-skills' DSL dynamic stop-loss engine.

### Why pluggable AI brain?
The research prompt and verdict parser are stable; only the transport changes.
Keeping OpenRouter, Claude CLI, and Codex CLI behind one provider interface lets
the operator switch the decision-maker without adding another executor or another
prompt/parse path. LONG/SHORT/CLOSE verdicts still flow through the same risk
gates, kill switch, close helper, and DSL exit engine.

### Why Hyperfeed Discovery?
The HL leaderboard and whale tracking aren't exposed through the public API. This module reconstructs the same data patterns (leaderboard rankings, smart money concentration, OI anomalies) from the raw HL endpoints we already call. No external MCP dependency needed.

### Why pure Python?
Rewritten from TypeScript/Next.js to enable simpler deployment, MCP integration with Pathiel Agent, and native testability without a headless browser.

## Rate Limit Math

| Operation | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `allMids` | 2 | Real-time prices |
| `metaAndAssetCtxs` | 20 | Universe + volume + OI (perp) |
| `spotMetaAndAssetCtxs` | 20 | Universe + volume + OI (spot) |
| `candleSnapshot` (per coin) | 20 | Plus per-item weight |
| **Total per scan cycle** | ~900-1,100 | Top 45 markets plus a small sweep, one 5m candle fetch each |

With `PATHIEL_MAX_MARKETS=45`, a small `PATHIEL_UNIVERSE_SWEEP`, and a 50s candle-cache TTL, each 60s scan fetches fresh 5m candles while keeping room for mids, HIP-3 metadata, dashboard/account calls, and occasional 1h enrichment. The cache TTL is deliberately kept just below the scan interval so the scanner never reacts to a stale snapshot — raising it would re-introduce that lag.

The crypto/HIP-3 budget split (`PATHIEL_MAX_MARKETS_HIP3`) is a *partition* of the same scan budget, not extra calls. If 429s or data gaps show up, lower `PATHIEL_UNIVERSE_SWEEP` or increase `PATHIEL_BATCH_SLEEP` before tightening strategy gates.

When HIP-3 is enabled, `fetch_account_state(user, include_hip3=True)` issues one extra `clearinghouseState` POST per registered HIP-3 dex (~8 dexes × weight 2 = ~16 weight). The aggregated path is used by the dashboard, the trading-loop heartbeat, and the MCP `state`/`portfolio` handlers. MCP `close_position` delegates to `executor.close_position_market()`, so closes share the same reduce-only order path, DSL cleanup, trigger-order cancellation, and loss-cooldown behavior as loop exits.

## Built With

- FastAPI — Python web framework
- OpenRouter / Claude CLI / Codex CLI — AI research brain providers
- Hyperliquid Python SDK — perpetual futures DEX
- Brave Search API (optional, for news signals)
- Prometheus (`prometheus-client`) — `/metrics` instrumentation + observability
- Kubernetes (kind + kube-prometheus-stack) — local deployment & Grafana dashboards (see [`k8s/`](k8s/README.md))

It is **operated by** [Pathiel Agent](https://github.com/Julian-dev28/pathiel-agent)
through the MCP server — Pathiel Agent is not a build dependency; the trading
engine is plain Python.

**Note:** Project trunk is `main` (Python). The legacy TypeScript/Next.js implementation lives on archived branches.
