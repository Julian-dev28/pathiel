"""When every slot is full, the loop must stop PAYING to look.

THE WASTE THIS CLOSES
max_concurrent refuses a new entry at the END of the pipeline - after the candle
fetches, after news_surge_short has called coin_catalyst() once per coin (a
Google News fetch each), and after research() has spent a Claude call on every
survivor. With a 24h hold and 3 slots the book fills early and every later cycle
re-derives candidates it is structurally unable to act on.

WHAT MUST STILL RUN, AND WHY EACH ONE MATTERS
  monitor_exits   open positions still need managing. Gate this and capital sits
                  in a position nothing is watching - the stop never fires.
  the recorders   data_logger appends the funding/OI panel that every research
                  script reads. Skipping it leaves a hole for exactly the
                  periods the book was fully deployed, which is survivorship
                  bias baked into every future backtest. The most expensive
                  possible saving.

These are asserted structurally, over the AST, because the failure mode is a
future edit: someone adds a fifth book and forgets the guard, and nothing breaks
loudly - the loop just quietly goes back to paying full price. A grep would miss
it; the tree does not.
