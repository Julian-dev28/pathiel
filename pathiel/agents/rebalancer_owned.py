"""Shared ownership tracker for cross-sectional rebalancers.

Each strategy book manages its own isolated set of coins. Without this, a book's close list
would include ALL live account positions — including those opened by the thought-engine or
other books — and destructively close foreign positions.

Usage pattern in each rebalancer's maybe_rebalance():
    owned = _get_owned()                        # module-level singleton, loaded from disk
    owned.prune(live_coin_set)                  # drop coins closed externally / stopped out
    cur_long, cur_short = owned.current_book()  # ONLY this rebalancer's positions
    plan = rebalance_plan(book, cur_long, cur_short)
    # execute plan ...
    for coin in plan["close_long"] + plan["close_short"]:
        close_fn(coin)
        owned.remove(coin)
    for coin in plan["open_long"]:
        execute_fn(analysis(coin, "long", ...))
        owned.add(coin, "long")
    for coin in plan["open_short"]:
        execute_fn(analysis(coin, "short", ...))
        owned.add(coin, "short")
    owned.save()

Invariant: close_long/close_short can ONLY contain coins in owned.longs/owned.shorts,
because cur_long/cur_short are derived exclusively from the owned set (intersected against
live positions). Foreign positions (opened by other strategies) are NEVER in cur_long/cur_short
and therefore never in close_long/close_short.

Cross-book claims registry (ClaimsRegistry)
==========================================
Each live strategy book can target ANY coin in the liquid universe. Because the exchange holds ONE
net position per coin, two books simultaneously holding the same coin either (a) net/cancel on
the exchange, or (b) when one book closes via close_position_market(coin), it closes the ENTIRE
net position — stomping on the other book's leg.

ClaimsRegistry is a file-backed map {coin -> owning_book_name} shared across all live strategy
modules. A book must CLAIM a coin before opening it; a coin can be claimed by AT MOST ONE book
at a time. Any book that is not the owner gets that coin filtered OUT of its candidate universe
before even ranking/planning. On close/prune the owning book releases its claim.

The claim file (.rebalancer_claims.json) uses best-effort reads/writes (same pattern as
other state files). The single-threaded trading loop means concurrent writes within one cycle
are not a risk, but we load-merge-save defensively to guard against mid-cycle restarts.

The claim registry is intentionally shared by the live EV+ books so one strategy cannot
silently net out or close another strategy's coin.
