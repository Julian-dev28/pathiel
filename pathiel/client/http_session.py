"""Shared HTTP-session hardening for Hyperliquid SDK clients.

Split out of `exchange.py` (2026-08-30) so `hl_client.py` can use it without
importing `exchange.py` — the two previously formed an import cycle broken
only by a deferred import inside `hl_client.init_info()`. This function has
no dependency on anything else in either module: it's a pure duck-typed
wrapper over `client.session.request`, so it belongs in its own leaf module
regardless of the cycle.
