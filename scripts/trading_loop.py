"""Continuous trading loop for pathiel.

Per cycle: scan the universe, run every live book, review open positions, and
manage exits. ENTRIES COME FROM BOOKS ONLY — the discretionary
scan -> TA filter -> research -> execute path was deleted (W-ME1, 2026-08-30)
after it graded +2.15% against a +1.61% random-entry null and fired zero times
in 17 days at the live gate. A scanned coin that no book claims is normal, not
a refusal.

The TA filter and the AI research call still run, but only for coins the
account ALREADY HOLDS: they decide whether to close early. Book-owned
positions are exempt — each book owns its own exit.

Every cycle and decision is appended to the session log (`session_log`), which
backs the /activity feed and the decision funnel.

Flags (tolerant — unknown flags are ignored so legacy callers keep working):
  --env {prod,dev}  Currently informational; loaded from .env.local in CWD.
  --daemon          Currently informational; the loop already daemonizes via
                    `nohup ... &` / Pathiel background. Kept for skill scripts.
