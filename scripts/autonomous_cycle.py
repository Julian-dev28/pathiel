"""The evidence loop, without a human in it.

Standing operator order (2026-07-20): "all tasks where I have to talk to you
should be automated... you have full reign to evolve, research, theorize and
grow, prune and add." This script is that order made deterministic. It runs on
cron, grades every book against its own forward ledger, and ACTS — promoting
what the evidence earns, demoting what it refutes — then reports what it did.

Decision table (per book, evaluated every run):

  n < MIN_N                                   -> PENDING, no action
  EV <= 0 at the real fee tier                -> DEMOTE  (live -> shadow_only)
  EV > 0 AND both OOS halves > 0
       AND survives 25bps AND mc_p < 0.05     -> PROMOTE (shadow -> live, bounded)
  otherwise (MARGINAL)                        -> hold, no action

Asymmetry is deliberate and is the core safety property: DEMOTION needs only a
non-positive EV at the grader's min-n, because stopping a bleed is cheap and
being wrong costs a forgone edge. PROMOTION additionally demands both OOS
halves positive, survival at a 4x-conservative cost tier, and significance
against a matched same-coin random-time null — because being wrong there costs
real money. A book can be demoted by evidence that would never have promoted it.

Every promotion is BOUNDED: $20 notional, 10x leverage, a reachable stop (the
executor clamps the backup SL to 60/leverage percent, so a wider stop is
decoration), and it inherits the same n=8 review bar it was just promoted by —
so a promoted book that turns is demoted by the next run, automatically.

Config is hot-read, so promotions/demotions need NO restart. Code is untouched.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/autonomous_cycle.py            # grade + act + report
    python3 scripts/autonomous_cycle.py --dry-run  # report only, change nothing
    python3 scripts/autonomous_cycle.py --json
